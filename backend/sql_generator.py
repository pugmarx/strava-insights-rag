    ## Database Schema
    CREATE TABLE activities (
        activity_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
        activity_type VARCHAR(50),
        distance DOUBLE PRECISION,
        duration INTEGER,
        timestamp TIMESTAMP,
        embedding VECTOR(384)
    );
    
    Use PostgreSQL syntax.
    
    ## Query Rules:
    - The `embedding` column stores a 384-dimensional vector representing the activity. It is used to find similar activities.
    - Use the `<=>` operator for cosine similarity between embeddings. It returns a FLOAT, not a BOOLEAN.
    - Never use `<=>` directly in a JOIN ... ON clause unless it is wrapped in a comparison (e.g., `< 0.5`) or placed inside `ORDER BY`.
    - To find the most similar activity, use `<=>` inside an `ORDER BY` clause and `LIMIT 1`.
    - Use `timestamp` for time-based queries.
    - Use `distance` and `duration` for activity performance queries.
    - Use `embedding <=> embedding` for cosine similarity queries.
    - Use cosine similarity (`<=>`) on the `embedding` vector column when needed.
    - Always return `activity_id`, `activity_type`, `distance`, `duration`, and `timestamp` in the SELECT statement.
    - PostgreSQL does **not support** YEAR(timestamp). Instead, use: EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "timestamp")
    - Same for month: use EXTRACT(MONTH FROM "timestamp")
    - Use double quotes for column names when needed (like "timestamp")
    - Write SQL that finds similar runs using embedding comparison, and if you use subqueries or CTEs, make sure to include all columns that are referenced later (e.g. timestamp).
    - Just return the SQL query, no other text.
    
    
    ## **Examples**
    ### Example 1: Find my longest run
    User Question: "What was my longest run?"
    SQL Query:
    SELECT activity_id, activity_type, distance, duration, timestamp 
    FROM activities 
    WHERE activity_type = 'Run' 
    ORDER BY distance DESC 
    LIMIT 1;
    
    ### Example 2: Find similar activities to my last run
    User Question: "Find similar activities to my last 'Run' activity"
    SQL Query:
    WITH last_run AS (
        SELECT embedding FROM activities 
        WHERE activity_type = 'Run' 
        ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
        LIMIT 1
    )
    SELECT activity_id, activity_type, distance, duration, timestamp, 
           1 - (embedding <=> (SELECT embedding FROM last_run)) AS similarity_score
    FROM activities
    ORDER BY similarity_score DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    
    ### Example 3: Find my most active month
    User Question: "Which month was I most active?"
    SQL Query:
    SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', timestamp) AS activity_month, 
           COUNT(*) AS total_activities 
    FROM activities 
    GROUP BY activity_month 
    ORDER BY total_activities DESC 
    LIMIT 1;

    ### Example: Find the year with the least number of activities
    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp) AS activity_year, COUNT(*) AS total_activities
    FROM activities
    GROUP BY activity_year
    ORDER BY total_activities ASC
    LIMIT 1;
